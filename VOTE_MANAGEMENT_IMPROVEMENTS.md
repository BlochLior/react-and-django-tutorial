# Vote Management Improvements - Complete Implementation

## Overview
This document details the comprehensive vote management improvements that enable users to:
- View their previous votes pre-selected when re-answering
- Remove votes by clicking selected choices again
- Submit with all votes removed (with warning)
- Have complete control over their voting experience

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Pre-loaded Previous Votes**
When users navigate to the polls page (to re-answer), their previous votes are automatically fetched and pre-selected.

**How it works:**
- On component mount, `PollsContainer` fetches user votes via `/polls/user-votes/`
- Previous selections are extracted and set in `selectedAnswers` state
- Users see their choices already selected, making it clear what they voted for

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Fetch user's previous votes
const { data: userVotesResponse, loading: loadingUserVotes } = useQuery(
    async () => pollsApi.getUserVotes(),
    [],
    { errorMessage: 'Failed to fetch your previous votes.', enabled: true }
);

// Pre-populate selectedAnswers
useEffect(() => {
    if (userVotesResponse && !initialAnswersLoaded) {
        const previousVotes = {};
        userVotesResponse.results?.forEach(question => {
            if (question.user_selected_choice_id) {
                previousVotes[question.id] = question.user_selected_choice_id;
            }
        });
        setSelectedAnswers(previousVotes);
        setInitialAnswersLoaded(true);
    }
}, [userVotesResponse, initialAnswersLoaded]);
```

### 2. **Vote Deselection (Toggle Behavior)**
Users can click a selected choice again to deselect/remove their vote for that question.

**Visual Feedback:**
- When a choice is selected, a helpful tip appears: "üí° Tip: Click your selected answer again to deselect it"
- Clicking removes the selection visually and from state

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const handleAnswerChange = (questionId, choiceId) => {
    setSelectedAnswers((prev) => {
        // If clicking the same choice again, remove it (deselect)
        if (prev[questionId] === choiceId) {
            const newAnswers = { ...prev };
            delete newAnswers[questionId];
            return newAnswers;
        }
        // Otherwise, select the new choice
        return { ...prev, [questionId]: choiceId };
    });
};
```

### 3. **Empty Vote Warning Modal**
If users deselect ALL votes and try to submit, a warning modal appears.

**Warning Message:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: You are about to remove all your votes!

If you submit with no answers selected, all your previous votes 
will be permanently deleted and cannot be retrieved.

Are you sure you want to continue?
```

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const handleVoteSubmission = async () => {
    const votes_dict = {};
    for (const questionId in selectedAnswers) {
        votes_dict[parseInt(questionId, 10)] = parseInt(selectedAnswers[questionId], 10);
    }

    // If removing all votes, show warning
    if (Object.keys(votes_dict).length === 0 && initialAnswersLoaded) {
        onWarningOpen();
        return;
    }

    await submitVotes(votes_dict);
};
```

### 4. **Complete Vote Replacement (Backend)**
The backend endpoint supports atomic vote updates:
- Removes ALL existing user votes
- Adds new votes from the request
- Handles empty votes (removes all)

**Benefits:**
- Clean state management
- No orphaned votes
- Consistent vote counts
- Supports vote removal

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### **Stale Cache After Vote Deletion (Low Priority)**
**Issue:** When deleting all votes from Review page and immediately returning to Polls page, previous selections may briefly appear cached.

**Status:** Documented in KNOWN_ISSUES.md - Not breaking functionality, planned for future cache management improvements.

**Impact:** Minimal - Edge case behavior, does not affect data integrity or vote submission accuracy.
