# but if you ever switch to SQLite for local development, these keep the database out of git.

# Compiled static files (if collected locally)

# Custom Django management command output (if any)
# e.g., if a command generates reports or temporary files

# Local settings override (if you use a local_settings.py that's not committed)

# uv-specific (already covered by root .gitignore, but good to have here for self-containment)
# uv.lock # You typically WANT to commit uv.lock!
# This is usually commented out or excluded explicitly to prevent accidental commits
