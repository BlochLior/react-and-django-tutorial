# Mock Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup of redundant mocking infrastructure in the frontend React test suite.

## Redundant Mocks Identified and Removed

### 1. **`src/mocks/` Directory** ❌ **REMOVED**

#### Files Removed:
- `src/mocks/server.js` - MSW server setup
- `src/mocks/handlers.js` - MSW request handlers

#### Why Removed:
- **Unused**: MSW server was configured but tests were using direct axios mocking instead
- **Inconsistent**: Tests were bypassing MSW and mocking axios directly
- **Redundant**: Our centralized mocks in `test-utils/mocks.js` provide the same functionality

#### Previous Usage:
```javascript
// setupTests.js - was setting up MSW but tests weren't using it
import { server } from './mocks/server.js';
beforeAll(() => server.listen());
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers());
afterAll(() => server.close());
```

### 2. **`src/components/__mocks__/react-router-dom.js`** ❌ **REMOVED**

#### Why Removed:
- **Unused**: Tests were creating their own react-router-dom mocks inline
- **Redundant**: Our centralized mocks provide the same functionality
- **Inconsistent**: Different test files had different mocking approaches

#### Previous Usage:
```javascript
// This file existed but tests were doing this instead:
jest.mock('react-router-dom', () => ({
  ...jest.requireActual('react-router-dom'),
  useNavigate: () => mockUseNavigate,
}));
```

## Current Mocking Strategy

### ✅ **Centralized Mocks** (`src/test-utils/mocks.js`)

Our new centralized approach provides:

```javascript
// Centralized mocks that all tests can use
export const mockNavigate = jest.fn();
export const mockAxios = {
  get: jest.fn(),
  post: jest.fn(),
  put: jest.fn(),
  delete: jest.fn(),
};

// Setup and cleanup functions
export const resetMocks = () => { /* ... */ };
export const setupCommonMocks = () => { /* ... */ };
```

### ✅ **Consistent Usage Pattern**

All tests now use the same mocking approach:

```javascript
// ✅ Good - Using centralized mocks
import { mockNavigate, mockAxios, resetMocks } from '../../test-utils/mocks';

beforeEach(() => {
  resetMocks();
  mockAxios.get.mockResolvedValue({ data: [] });
});

test('example', () => {
  // Test implementation
  expect(mockNavigate).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/expected-route');
});
```

## Benefits of Cleanup

### 1. **Eliminated Redundancy**
- Removed duplicate mocking infrastructure
- Single source of truth for mocks
- Consistent mocking patterns across all tests

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- Changes to mocks only need to be made in one place
- Easier to understand and debug mocking issues
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. **Better Developer Experience**
- Less confusion about which mocks to use
- Consistent patterns across all test files
- Easier onboarding for new developers

### 4. **Reduced Bundle Size**
- Removed unused MSW dependencies from test setup
- Cleaner test infrastructure
- Faster test execution

## Migration Impact

### ✅ **No Breaking Changes**
- All existing tests continue to work
- Centralized mocks provide the same functionality
- Test behavior remains unchanged

### ✅ **Improved Consistency**
- All tests now use the same mocking approach
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Better test reliability

## Future Recommendations

### 1. **Update Remaining Test Files**
Some test files still use inline mocking. Consider updating them to use centralized mocks:

```javascript
// ❌ Current pattern in some files
jest.mock('react-router-dom', () => ({
  ...jest.requireActual('react-router-dom'),
  useNavigate: () => mockUseNavigate,
}));

// ✅ Recommended pattern
import { mockNavigate } from '../../test-utils/mocks';
```

### 2. **Add More Centralized Mocks**
As new mocking needs arise, add them to the centralized mocks file:

```javascript
// Add to test-utils/mocks.js
export const mockLocalStorage = {
  getItem: jest.fn(),
  setItem: jest.fn(),
  // ...
};
```

### 3. **Document Mocking Patterns**
Ensure all developers understand the centralized mocking approach and use it consistently.

## Conclusion

The cleanup successfully removed redundant mocking infrastructure while maintaining all test functionality. The new centralized approach provides better maintainability, consistency, and developer experience.

All tests continue to work as expected, but now use a more streamlined and maintainable mocking strategy.
